```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
  collapse = TRUE,
  comment = "#>"
)
```

At this point, this is an experimental package, and you can only install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` {r, eval=F}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("matiasandina/ggethos")
```
